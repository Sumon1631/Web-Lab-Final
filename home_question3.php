The University is serving the citizens of the country through its instructions, research, and outreach programs and preparing Bangladesh to respond successfully to the challenges of global economy. The University has proved that it provides students broad access to the institution's educational resources. (Possible suggestion: For educational programs in campus and beyond, the university is giving high priority on the use of new and outreach technologies available in the emerging information era.) The University has paid the highest priority to resource allocation to graduate and post graduate education and for future development of those areas that represent the traditional strengths, quality, reputation, and uniqueness of the institution which continue to effectively respond to the needs of students and other constituents. Consistent with this commitment, the university is emphasizing on high quality education including a comprehensive general education that imparts the broad knowledge, skills, and values which are essential to educate and make citizens responsible as well as to ensure specialized career preparation for students.

The primary focus of this research is to be directed to the solution of problems and the development of knowledge and technology important to the nation and to the quality of life of Bangladeshi citizens. The university's research programs are designed to make important contributions to instructional programs through the involvement of graduate and postgraduate students and the renewal of the faculty.

                    Extension and outreach programs are fundamental to the IT-based mission because these programs somehow directly affect the lives of the entire world. The University is maintaining the strengths of its traditional outreach programs and increasingly involves the broader university in outreach programs that respond to the changing needs of the society in which we live. The university is continuing to seek new and innovative ways to reach out to the people it serves.

                    DIU offers bachelor degrees in the different spectrum of disciplines and provides the country's highly supported programs in many fields, including in IT, Telecommunications, Engineering and Business. Particularly strong programs can be found in the faculty of Business, Information Technology and Engineering and English Language.

                    Research is the means through which new knowledge is created and new information is developed. As such, research at Daffodil International University is an essential link in its three-prong mission of instruction, research and outreach. Successes among the varied research activities within each of its students and faculties continue to bolster Daffodil among the nation's top universities.
